        <h2>Welcome To My Garden!</h2>
        <p>
            When I first got into gardening in my twenties, I didn't know what I was doing, but that didn't stop me from trying! Of course, I could've researched what to do, but who has time for that? So I planted some seeds and wasn't very successful. Now flash forward to now, I have a porch garden that I decided to finally invest in. I bought local plants and ones that specifically worked for the area. I started using the app Picture This to help track my plants and get tips to when they get sick. And they definitely got sick. So check out more of my story in the links below, as well as Tips and Tricks. If I can have a blooming garden, so can you!
