First Code Fellows website from scratch. I've focused on my garden as I have made great strides in it and felt this concept could be utilized to create a community website later down the line.

I started with a wireframe and then coded with HTML, and CSS, and Javascript. I used the help of ChatGPT to point me in a direction to get started with implemneting my ideas.
